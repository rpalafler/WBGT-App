# **WBGT Application**

Welcome to the WBGT (Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature) application! This project is a full-stack web application designed to display and analyze weather-related data in an interactive and visually engaging way. Inspired aesthetically by [Ventusky](http://ventusky.com/), this project is simplified for educational and practical purposes.

---

## **Project Overview**

The WBGT application serves as a platform to:

- Visualize interactive maps using various basemaps and layers.
- Provide tools to analyze environmental and geographical data.
- Include information about the application, its creators, and its versioning.

The project is built step by step, starting with the frontend in React and progressively adding backend functionality to store and process data.

---

## **Tech Stack**

The project uses the following technologies:

### **Frontend**

- **React**: For building a dynamic user interface.
- **DeckGL**: For rendering interactive maps.
- **OpenStreetMap**: As the default basemap provider.

### **Backend** (planned)

- **Node.js** with **FastAPI**: To create APIs for data fetching and processing.
- **Database**: A database system (to be determined) for storing data.

---

## **Current Features**

1. **Interactive Map**:

   - The initial map is displayed with OpenStreetMap as the default basemap.
   - The map is currently centered on the United States.

2. **Basic UI Setup**:
   - The frontend structure is modular and scalable, ready for future features.

---

## **Planned Features**

- **Basemap Switching**:
  - Users will be able to toggle between different basemaps, such as OpenStreetMap, Google Topography, and others.
- **Application Info**:

  - A dedicated section with details about the app, such as the version, creation date, and contributors.

- **Data Analysis Tools**:

  - Visualization layers for weather and environmental data.

- **Backend Integration**:
  - A robust backend to support dynamic data loading and user interaction.

## **Folder Structure**

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **frontend/**: Contains all the React-related code.
- **backend/** (planned): Will house the backend code.
- **docs/** (planned): Documentation, such as API references and developer notes.

# 🌍 WBGT App - Frontend

## ✨ Introduction

Welcome to the **WBGT App**, a project that’s just getting started! This app is an exciting learning journey into building a complete web application, starting with the **frontend** in React and eventually expanding into a fully functional backend.

The inspiration for the app comes from platforms like [Ventusky](http://ventusky.com/), with a goal to create a simplified, interactive world map experience. While the project is still in its infancy, it already has a clear direction: to make geographic data interactive, accessible, and visually appealing.

## 🛠️ Current State

Right now, the frontend is in its foundational stage. Here’s what’s been implemented so far:

- **World Map with DeckGL**: The app starts by displaying an interactive map of the world using the powerful DeckGL library. Although minimalistic for now, the map will soon have advanced features like multiple basemaps and layers.
- **Two Essential Buttons**:
  - **"App Info" Button**: Redirects users to a page that will provide details about the app, such as its creation, contributors, and current version.
  - **"Change Basemap" Button**: Allows users to switch between different basemaps, including Google XYZ, OpenStreetMap, and Google Topography.

This is just the beginning, and there’s so much more planned for the future.

## 🚀 Vision and Goals

The ultimate vision for the app is to provide an interactive platform where users can explore global data in an intuitive and dynamic way. Here’s what’s coming next:

- A fully functional **App Info page**, showcasing details about the app’s version, team, and history.
- Enhanced map functionalities, such as dynamic layers, data overlays, and user interactions.
- A smooth and intuitive **user interface** inspired by modern web applications.

## 🧩 Technologies in Use

Here’s what powers the current stage of the project:

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing component-based architecture.
- **DeckGL**: For rendering the interactive map.
- **TileLayer (from DeckGL)**: To load map tiles directly from XYZ tile servers.

Here’s what powers the current stage of the project:

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing component-based architecture.
- **DeckGL**: For rendering the interactive map.
- **Mapbox**: Provides the basemaps displayed in the app.
- **React Router**: To handle navigation between pages (e.g., the map and the App Info page).
- **React Icons**: Adds beautiful icons to buttons and other UI elements.
